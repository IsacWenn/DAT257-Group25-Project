Individual Reflection week 1:


1. For next week I would like to be better at continuously communicating 
between the different programing pairs to avoid confusion when it comes 
time to put our work together. I also hope to get more comfortable with the best 
practices for flutter since it is a new language.

2. My contributions were related to the discussion and 
then mainly towards the projects backend development. I worked to 
integrate the weather api, handle the json it returned and then parse it into a 
format that we could deliver to the front end for use. Next sprint I hope to do a 
better job at documenting my work.
