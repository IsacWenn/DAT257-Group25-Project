Individual Reflection Week 1 - Isac Ingvast Wennerstr√∂m : 

1.   For next week I would like to improve my understanding and abilities in the Flutter Framework and the Dart language.
This is the first time I'm working with either of these tools so I have learnt a lot during this first week. 
I would also like to improve my teamwork so that we can be more efficient in the future. 

2.   My contributions this week where split in two parts. Initially my teammembers and I spent some time really planning what
we where going to be doing and how during this sprint. During this planning stage I helped with formulating a valid plan for the week. 
Codewise my contributions have largely been towards helping my teammates with their problems. Together with Carl however I developed a 
standard utility class for sending weather data from our backend to our frontend. During the next sprint I'm going to focus more on
helping my teammates and working together with them than I did during this week. This feels like the largest hindrance of my contributions 
and is something I should definetly improve.
