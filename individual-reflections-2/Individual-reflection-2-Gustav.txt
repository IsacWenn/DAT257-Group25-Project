1) I want to focus on developing a better understanding of working with the front end parts
of a flutter project, since I have been working solely on the backend and api integration
in these first two sprints. Mainly I want to learn how to display all of the functionallity
that we have been working on in a nice way on mobile screens.

2) This week my contributions have been focused on further developing the functionallity
of our weather functions and integrating a day and night cycle into our app which was done
by an additional api call. I have also worked together with Andreas to implement location
reading into our app allowing it to know where you are. Further developing that we also integrated
reverse geocoding allowing your current coordinates to be translated into an actuall place that 
can be displayed.

3) Next week I hope to take a more active role in the planning phase, this week I was allready
pretty sure of what I wanted to acomplish personally but I could have taken a more active role
and helped my team in finding out what meaningfull work they could do.
