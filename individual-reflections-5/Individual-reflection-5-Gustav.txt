1) Next week I want to learn more about the entire project focusing on the parts that I was not a
part of developing. I look forward to learning more from my team and getting a better understanding
of the final project. 

2) This week my contributions have been focused on further developing the login page of our application.
The changes I made where both visual and functionall. It is now more dynamic in it's navigation
and is accompanied by some soothing visuals to set the tone for the rest of our application. It also layers
the functionallity for logging in and forgotten passwords on the same page while rederecting users to a 
single dedicated page for registering to the app.

3) Next week I hope to spend more time analyzing other peoples code so that we can have a nice and clean
final codebase.
