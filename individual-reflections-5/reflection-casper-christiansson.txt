1) For next spring I want to dig deeper in the code and understand the parts I haven't worked on myself better so that
it can be improved and refactored.

2) I have worked mostly on the aesthetic this week. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to generate images using Midjourney
so that they properly fit our app and keep the same theme.

3) I've learned a lot about new AI services such as Dall-E, Midjourney, Fakeyou and Elevenlabs.
